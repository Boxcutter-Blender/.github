## 🧠 Overview  

**Boxcutter** is a powerful Blender add-on built around a fast, non-destructive boolean workflow. It allows artists to cut, slice, and shape geometry interactively while preserving clean topology and flexible editing control.

Instead of committing to permanent mesh changes, Boxcutter works with live operations that can be adjusted at any stage. This makes it ideal for concept modeling, hard-surface design, and iterative workflows where shapes evolve rapidly.

Designed to feel native to Blender, Boxcutter integrates tightly with viewport tools and common modeling actions, enabling a fluid and efficient modeling experience.
